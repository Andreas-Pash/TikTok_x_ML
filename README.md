# **TikTok Project**
**A machine learning classification model to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion.**


**The purpose** of this model is to increase response time and system efficiency by automating the initial stages of the claims process.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".

*We will be performing the following three parts:*

**Part 1:** EDA 

* Carry out Exploratory Data Analysis and define the objective of the model. 

**Part 2:** Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

**Part 3:** Modeling

* Build the models (Random Forest and XGBoost), evaluate them, and advise on next steps
